# Building your own Syringe Pump 

### What is a Syringe Pump? 
A syringe pump is a pump that delivers precise and accurate amounts of fluid, typically in research environments. A syringe pump can handle very small fluid deliveries and usually handles smaller volumes. 

### Why bother building your own Syringe Pump? 
Although pre-made syringe pumps are readily available, you can save a lot of money by buying the parts and building a syringe pump yourself. (as shown on this website!)
