# Additional Factors to Consider

## How many steps per mL? 
Typically, a stepper motor takes 200 steps per rotation. However, with microstepping, the stepper motor can take 1/16 of the original step size. Therefore, with microstepping, a stepper motor could take 3,200 steps per rotation. 

## What is the resolution? 
resolution stuff goes here 

## What is the limiting factor on the maximum flow rate?  
700 rpm is the maximum amount of turns that the motor can perform before the torque gives out. However, the actual value that the motor will spin is less than that due to friction between the nut and bolt.
